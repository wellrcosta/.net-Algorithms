# Study Guide: Algorithms - Using .NET Core 8

This document outlines the creation of various algorithms in .NET Core 8 for educational purposes. The algorithms chosen for this study are:

- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Hashing
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- RSA
- Selection Sort

## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

### Why Study Binary Search?

- **Efficiency**: Binary Search is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(log n), making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Understanding Search Algorithms**: It's a fundamental algorithm that helps in understanding how search operations can be optimized.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Why Study Bubble Sort?

- **Understanding Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that helps in understanding the concept of sorting.
- **Comparison with Other Sorts**: It provides a basis for comparing with more efficient sorting algorithms.

## Hashing

Hashing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text, using a mathematical function. It's used in various applications, including data retrieval, password storage, and data integrity checks.

### Why Study Hashing?

- **Data Security**: Hashing is crucial for data security, especially in password storage and data integrity checks.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: It allows for efficient data retrieval in databases and other data structures.

## Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.

### Why Study Heap Sort?

- **Understanding Heap Data Structures**: Heap Sort is a practical application of heap data structures, helping in understanding their use cases.
- **Comparison with Other Sorts**: It provides a basis for comparing with other sorting algorithms in terms of performance.

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### Why Study Quick Sort?

- **Efficiency**: Quick Sort is efficient with an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Divide and Conquer Approach**: It's a good example of the divide and conquer strategy in algorithm design.

## RSA

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

### Why Study RSA?

- **Cryptography**: RSA is foundational to modern cryptography, understanding it is crucial for securing data and communications.
- **Public Key Cryptography**: It provides a practical example of public key cryptography, which is essential for secure digital communications.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the ordering) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.

### Why Study Selection Sort?

- **Understanding Sorting Algorithms**: Selection Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that helps in understanding the concept of sorting.
- **Comparison with Other Sorts**: It provides a basis for comparing with more efficient sorting algorithms.

## Model and Controller Structure

Each algorithm has been implemented with a model and controller structure in .NET Core 8. The model contains the type definition, and the controller contains the logic for the algorithm. 

Studying these algorithms provides a comprehensive understanding of various algorithmic concepts, including searching, sorting, cryptography, and data structures. Each algorithm has its unique characteristics and applications, making them essential for any programmer or computer scientist.
